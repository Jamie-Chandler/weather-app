# WEATHER APP

Built with Vanilla JS, using a weather API.

Weather API used: https://openweathermap.org


Biggest Challenges & Features: 
- Retrieving the Latitude and Longitude coordinates from the browser, and passing them into an API call.
- Sunrise and Sunset time were passed as UNIX Timestamp (e.g Sunrise: 1605770861). This was completely new to me and I had to learn how to change this into Date and Time, and then only pass the Hours and Minutes of this string.
- First time using an API, the documentation was great and easy to follow.
- Creating a 'search' function, that allows the user to search for a city and return the weather there, passing the City Name into the API call instead of Latitude & Longitude variables.
